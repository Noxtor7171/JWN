Balanced modpack with optimization and support to all shaders and resource packs for Optifine.
Modpack based on [Vanilla Extension](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vanilla-extension), but without resource packs and some features, more universal. But if you want to use only optimization, that can use [Optimized Maxima](https://modrinth.com/modpack/optimized-maxima).

I work on it:

 **üìàPerformance**

I tried to pay special attention to performance, so I chose all the mods that seemed to me the best for this. In the future, I want to improve it even more. I am trying to remove mods that are not being used.

</details>

I won't support 1.20.2 and 1.20.4. Because they have some problems with Quilt, Forge and NeoForge and devs less update mods for them. Please, use 1.20.1 or 1.20.6+. It's hard for me to update so many versions (understand me).
